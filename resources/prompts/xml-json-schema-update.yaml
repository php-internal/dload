          Look at `dload.xml`. It's an example of a DLOAD XML config file.

          1. Need to sync `dload.xsd` wit the `dload.xml` file and configs from `src/Module/Common/Config` folder.
             Read all of them and update the `dload.xsd` file.
          2. If there are any changes in the XML schema, update the `resources/software.schema.json` that
             describes the `software` section of the DLOAD XML config file but for json format.
