          Open {{class-name}} class.

          Cover it with comments or improve existing ones using following instructions:
          - Use passive forms instead of we or you.
          - Separate title and content with empty line.
          - Use @link annotation if it's necessary to write some URL.
          - Use @see annotation if it's necessary to reference to a class or method.
          - Keep only essential and non-obvious documentation.
          - Don't use @inheritDoc annotations.
          - Keep docs clean
            - if the method has the same signature in the parent interface, don't comment the implementation if there is no additional things.
            - remove trailing spaces
          - Use generic annotations if possible.
          - Use inline annotations like {@see ClassName} if it needed to  mention in a text block.
          - Add class or method usage example using markdown like.
            ```php
             // Comment for the following code
             some code
            ```
          - Inner comments order: title, description, example, template annotations, params and return annotations, references and internal/deprecated annotations.
          - Property comments rules: If it possible, write inline comment without title like `/** @var non-empty-string $name User name */`.
          - Multiline comments rules: if a comment starts with an annotation, the second line should start with whitespaces aligned with the annotation length:
            ```php
            /**
             * @var non-empty-string $name Comment on the first line
             *      comment on the second line...
             *      comment on the third line
             */
            ```
