          Read {{class-name}} class(es) or interface(s).

          Cover it with comments using following important instructions:
          - Don't break signatures. You can only add or improve comments.
          - Don't remove existing @internal, @link, @see, @api, or @deprecated annotations.
          - Use passive forms instead of we or you.
          - Separate title and content with empty line.
          - Use @link annotation if it's necessary to write some URL.
          - Use @see annotation if it's necessary to reference to a class or method.
          - Use extended types like class-string, non-empty-string, non-empty-array, non-empty-list, etc, if it's logically correct.
          - Don't use @inheritDoc annotations.
          - Keep docs clean:
            - If the method has the same signature in the parent, don't comment the implementation if there is no additional things.
            - Keep only essential and non-obvious documentation. It's important to avoid redundancy.
            - remove trailing spaces even in empty comment lines
          - Use generic annotations if possible based on the logic. For example for a `count()` has `int<0, max>` return type because the amount of items can't be negative.
          - Use inline annotations like {@see ClassName} if it needed to  mention in a text block.
          - Add class or method usage example using markdown like.
            Note that there is leading space before inside the code block:
            ```php
             // Comment for the following code
             some code
            ```
            If commenting a console command, feel fre to provide a usage example in the form of a command line:
            ```bash
             # Comment for the following command
             some command
            ```
            Don't skip internal classes.
          - Inner comments order: title, description, example, template annotations, params and return annotations, references and internal/deprecated annotations.
          - Property comments rules: If it possible, write inline comment without title like `/** @var non-empty-string $name User name */`.
          - Break long lines into multiple lines. Maximum line length is 120 characters.
            Multiline comments rules: if a comment starts with an annotation, the second line should start with whitespaces aligned with the annotation length:
            ```php
            /**
             * @var non-empty-string $name Comment on the first line
             *      comment on the second line...
             *      comment on the third line
             */
            ```
